### Project Simplifications

1. **No Database**: All data is stored in cache; no database is implemented.
2. **Single Controller**: A single controller handles both fetching data from an external API and retrieving data from the cache. Ideally, there should be two separate controllers for these responsibilities.
3. **Hangfire In-Memory**: Hangfire operates entirely in memory since no database is available.
4. **Extension Methods for Configuration**: The content of the `Program` class, especially Hangfire configuration, has been moved to dedicated extension methods.
5. **Cache Expiry**: Cached data is stored for 30 minutes.
6. **No Integration Tests**: Due to the lack of a database, integration tests are not implemented.
7. **Unit Test Preparation for Hangfire**: Unit tests for Hangfire calls are skipped. However, `IBackgroundJobClient _client` is injected to prepare for future testing.
8. **No Exception Service**: There is no dedicated service for handling exceptions.
9. **Returning All Stories**: If a user requests more stories than exist in the collection, all available stories are returned.
