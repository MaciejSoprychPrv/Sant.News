### Project Assumptions

1. **No Database**: All data is stored in cache; no database is implemented. There should be database in real life application to store Hangfire jobs and stories ids and and details.
2. **Hangfire**: Since Hangfire is pretty simple is usage and it does what is requested I implemented it. It has one big shortcoming it creates a lot of traffic on database site. In real life other solutions should considered like: MassTransit with ServiceBus or RabbitMQ. Depending on the volume of data.
3. **RetryPolicy**: Except for retries done by Hangfire whent it executes jobs there are no retries while storing data. Since it is cache there is no point in doing in real life with database it should be implemented. I would go for Polly.
4. **Single Controller**: A single controller handles both fetching data from an external API and retrieving data from the cache. Ideally, there should be two separate controllers for these responsibilities.
5. **Hangfire In-Memory**: Hangfire operates entirely in memory since no database is available.
6. **Extension Methods for Configuration**: The content of the `Program` class, especially Hangfire configuration, has been moved to dedicated extension methods.
7. **Cache Expiry**: Cached data is stored for 30 minutes.
8. **No Integration Tests**: Due to the lack of a database, integration tests are not implemented.
9. **Unit Test Preparation for Hangfire**: Unit tests for Hangfire calls are skipped. However, `IBackgroundJobClient _client` is injected to prepare for future testing.
10. **No Exception Service**: There is no dedicated service for handling exceptions.
11. **Returning All Stories**: If a user requests more stories than exist in the collection, all available stories are returned.
