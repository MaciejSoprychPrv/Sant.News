### Project Assumptions

1. **No Database**: All data is stored in cache; no database is implemented. There should be database in real life application to store Hangfire jobs and stories ids and and details.
2. **No Database** Since Hangfire is pretty simple is usage and it does what is requested I implemented it. It has one big shortcoming it creates a lot of traffic on database site. In real life other solutions should considered like: MassTransit with ServiceBus or RabbitMQ. Depending on the volume of data.
3. **Single Controller**: A single controller handles both fetching data from an external API and retrieving data from the cache. Ideally, there should be two separate controllers for these responsibilities.
4. **Hangfire In-Memory**: Hangfire operates entirely in memory since no database is available.
5. **Extension Methods for Configuration**: The content of the `Program` class, especially Hangfire configuration, has been moved to dedicated extension methods.
6. **Cache Expiry**: Cached data is stored for 30 minutes.
7. **No Integration Tests**: Due to the lack of a database, integration tests are not implemented.
8. **Unit Test Preparation for Hangfire**: Unit tests for Hangfire calls are skipped. However, `IBackgroundJobClient _client` is injected to prepare for future testing.
9. **No Exception Service**: There is no dedicated service for handling exceptions.
10. **Returning All Stories**: If a user requests more stories than exist in the collection, all available stories are returned.
